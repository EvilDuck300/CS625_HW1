## Data Prerocessing
To prepare the data for visualization, the following steps were performed:

Data Cleaning: Removed missing values and inconsistencies.

Filtering: Selected relevant subsets of the data to enhance readability.

Aggregation: Grouped data by meaningful categories to highlight trends.

Normalization: Standardized numerical values where necessary to ensure comparability.




Idiom: Bar Chart / Mark: Rectangle
| Data: Attribute | Data: Attribute Type  | Encode: Channel | 
| --- |---| --- |
| Category | Categorical | Vertical spatial region (y-axis) |
| Value | Quantitative | Horizontal position on a common scale (x-axis) |


Idiom: Scatterplot / Mark: Point
| Data: Attribute | Data: Attribute Type  | Encode: Channel | 
| --- |---| --- |
| X Variable | Quantitative | Horizontal spatial region (x-axis) |
| Y Variable | Quantitative | Horizontal position on a common Vertical spatial region (y-axis) |
