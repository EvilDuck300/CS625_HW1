## Data Prerocessing
To prepare the data for visualization, the following steps were performed:

Data Cleaning: Removed missing values and inconsistencies.

Filtering: Selected relevant subsets of the data to enhance readability.

Aggregation: Grouped data by meaningful categories to highlight trends.

Normalization: Standardized numerical values where necessary to ensure comparability.



# Visualization Idioms & Visual Encoding Choices
## Bar Chart (First Dataset)

Idiom: Bar Chart / Mark: Rectangle
| Data: Attribute | Data: Attribute Type  | Encode: Channel | 
| --- |---| --- |
| Category | Categorical | Vertical spatial region (y-axis) |
| Value | Quantitative | Horizontal position on a common scale (x-axis) |

## Scatterplot (Second Dataset)

Idiom: Scatterplot / Mark: Point
| Data: Attribute | Data: Attribute Type  | Encode: Channel | 
| --- |---| --- |
| X Variable | Quantitative | Horizontal spatial region (x-axis) |
| Y Variable | Quantitative | Horizontal position on a common Vertical spatial region (y-axis) |
| Category    | Categorical  | Color


## Area Chart (Third Dataset)

Idiom: Area Chart  / Mark: Area
| Data: Attribute | Data: Attribute Type  | Encode: Channel | 
| --- |---| --- |
| X Variable | Quantitative | Horizontal spatial region (x-axis) |
| Y Variable | Quantitative | Horizontal position on a common Vertical spatial region (y-axis) |
| Category    | Categorical  | Color



## Multiple Line Chart (Fourth Dataset)

Idiom: Area Chart  / Mark: Area
| Data: Attribute | Data: Attribute Type  | Encode: Channel | 
| --- |---| --- |
| X Variable | Quantitative | Horizontal spatial region (x-axis) |
| Y Variable | Quantitative | Horizontal position on a common Vertical spatial region (y-axis) |
| Category    | Categorical  | Line Color

# Customizations

Adjusted axis scales for better readability.

Used distinct colors to differentiate categories.

Added gridlines and labels for clarity.

Modified line thickness for better distinction.


# Reflection

For the chart recreated in another tool, the ease of use and customization capabilities were assessed. 

# References

List any external resources consulted for data processing, visualization techniques, or tool documentation.
