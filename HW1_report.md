### 1. What is the URL of the GitHub repo that you created in your personal account?  
[[Click on my repo](https://github.com/EvilDuck300/CS625_HW1.git)]  

### 2. What is pull vs clone in GitHub?  
- **Pull:** The `git pull` command is used to fetch and merge changes from a remote repository into your local repository. It updates your local branch with the latest changes from the remote branch.
- **Clone:** The `git clone` command is used to create a local copy of a remote repository. This is typically the first step to start working on a project hosted on GitHub.  

### 3. You have committed a change on your local machine/remote. However, you want to undo the changes committed. How would you do that?  
To undo a commit, use the commit command as shown below:  

-   
  ```bash
  git reset --soft HEAD~1
