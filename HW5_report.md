# Selected DataSet: Dataset 13
13 - State Population--Rank, Percent Change, And Population Density

# Introduction
This report uses the U.S. state population density from 1960 to 2009,  with the help of various kinds of data visualization. Understanding reasons for population distributions and interpreting the results using  Map vs Scatterplot will be very helpful.

# Data Prepocessing
 Before visualizing, cleaning and sorting of the dataset was done. The preprocessing steps included:
 * Loading  the dataset: The CSV file was imported using Pandas.

 * Cleaning data: Removing metadata rows, and  redundant column names. Renaming columns to make them consistent Numerical columns were converted to the right  data type.
* Dropping metadata rows and redundant headers.
* Renaming columns for consistency.Converting numerical columns to the correct data type.
* Sorting and structuring: The file was sorted by state name to maintain file coherency.

# Part 1: Distribution Charts

## Chart 1: Boxplot 
Title: Population Desnity
Description: In the bloxplot chart below represents the distrubution of population density for state years 1980 , 1990 , 2000 and 2009. For each year they have their own IQR using each box for each state with indiviual by points
